## Linux

In this chapter we are going to introduce a script and an associated service to enable backups of our channel database.

### Useful resources:

- [Static Channel Backups](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/safety#static-channel-backups-scbs)
- [Lightning Channel Backups](https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/ln-channel-backup/

### Install ionotify 

ionotify is a tool that watches for modifications of files and then perm

```shell
sudo apt install inotify-tools
```

Depending on what kind of updates we are getting we might have to confirm a few other prompts. Going with the defaults is generally fine for our purpose, so pressing the `Enter` key is enough.


```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/backup-channels.service
```

Paste the following into the editor:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/copy-channel-backup-on-change.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=backup-channels
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dropbox_backup.py
```

Paste the following into the editor:

```
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    inotifywait /home/ubuntu/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup
    /usr/local/bin/dropbox_backup.py
done
```

Set the permissions to the file is executable:

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/copy-channel-backup-on-change.sh
``` 

Enable the backup-channels service:

```
systemctl enable --now backup-channels.service
```

Test the backup service:

```
touch /home/ubuntu/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup
```
